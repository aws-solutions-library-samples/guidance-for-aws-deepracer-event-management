  "content": "In this page, you start and stop races and capture individual lap times. To start a race, select the **Start race** button. To capture individual lap times, select the **Capture lap** button (when the AWS DeepRacer car crosses over the finish line). If a racer’s car can’t complete a lap within the time limit, you can select **Did not finish** and the score will not appear on the leaderboard. If a car needs to be reset because all 4 tires go off the track, select **Car reset**. If an incorrect lap time is accidentally recorded, (by someone stepping on a timing strip or the time keeper capturing an incomplete lap), you can undo it by selecting **Undo false finish**. When the time limit for the race has elapsed, you end the race by selecting **End race**.\n\nDetails for the current racer, such as their fastest lap and recorded laps, appear in the **Fastest lap** and **Recorded laps** fields." ,
