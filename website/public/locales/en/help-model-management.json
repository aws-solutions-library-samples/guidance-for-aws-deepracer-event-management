Models with viruses are quarantined and can’t be deployed to AWS DeepRacer cars. Models are stored for 15 days.\n\nTo upload a model, select **Upload model**, navigate to your saved model and select **Open**. When the upload is complete, your model appears in the Models list. On event day, when it’s your turn to race, a pit crew member deploys your uploaded model to an AWS DeepRacer car for in-person racing.\n\nIf you upload a model, but it doesn’t appear in the Models list, it may have been quarantined or your browser may need to be refreshed.",
