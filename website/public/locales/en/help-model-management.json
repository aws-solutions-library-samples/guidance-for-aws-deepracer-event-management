When the upload is complete, your model appears in the **Models** list. On event day, when it’s your turn to race, the race organizer deploys your uploaded model to an AWS DeepRacer car for in-person racing.\n\nDuring upload, models are scanned automatically for viruses. Models with viruses are quarantined and can’t be deployed to AWS DeepRacer cars. Models are stored for 15 days.",
